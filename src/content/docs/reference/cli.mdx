Kando comes with a command line interface (CLI) that allows you to interact with Kando from the terminal.
You learn [how to run Kando from the terminal](/advanced-usage/launch-from-cli) in the advanced usage section.
For now, these commands are available:

<details>
<summary>`--help`</summary>
Prints the help message for the CLI.

<details>
<summary>`--version` or `-v`</summary>
Prints the version of Kando.
</details>

<details>
<summary>`--menu "Menu Name"` or `-m "Menu Name"`</summary>
Opens the menu with the given name.
This also works if Kando is already running.
In this case, the menu will be opened in the running instance.
</details>

<details>
<summary>`--settings` or `-s`</summary>

This can be useful if you are developing a theme and want to see the changes without restarting Kando.
