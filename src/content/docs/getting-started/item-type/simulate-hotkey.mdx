title: Simulate Hotkey
description: An Kando item which simulates a keyboard shortcut.
tableOfContents: false
---

This type is used to simulate simple keyboard events.
You can use this to trigger shortcuts in other applications to automate tasks.

You can use the menu editor to record a hotkey or directly type the hotkey into the corresponding field.
The latter is useful if you want to use a hotkey that is either not available on your keyboard or is globally bound to another application.
See [Valid Key Names](/reference/valid-keys) for details on the format of the hotkey.

## The Delayed Option

The item has an optional **Delayed** property which can enable or disable.
If enabled, the hotkey will be executed _after_ the Kando window is closed.
This can be useful if the shortcut targets another window which needs to be focused.

## Example Configuration

If you happen to edit your `menus.json` file by hand, you can create a Hotkey item with something like the following.
You can read more about the structure of the `menus.json` file in its [documentation](/reference/config-files).

The `data` property of the menu item must contain a `hotkey` property which contains the hotkey to simulate.
The optional `delayed` property will ensure that the hotkey is executed _after_ the Kando window is closed.
