## The Idea Behind Kando

Kando uses [Fitts's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law) to make menu navigation as fast as possible.
You do not have to aim at the items you want to select, but you can click anywhere in the wedge of an item!

<Aside type="tip" title="Did you know?">
Fitts's Law tells us that the time required to move to a target primarily depends on the distance to the target and the size of the target in direction of the movement. A pie menu minimizes the distance to the target and maximizes the size of the target!
</Aside>

In additions, Kando is a _marking menu_ (which were [described first about 30 years ago by Gordon Kurtenbach](https://www.research.autodesk.com/app/uploads/2023/03/the-design-and-evaluation.pdf_recHpUp1v9dc1n2CJ.pdf)).
As such it allows you to select items by drawing zig-zag lines. This is extremely powerful!
**You can select things in subsubsubmenus in well below a second without looking at your screen!**
You can watch the video below to get an idea how Kando works.
