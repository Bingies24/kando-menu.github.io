<Intro>
When you launch Kando, you will only see a small icon in the system tray.
You can open an example menu by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd>.
It can happen that the shortcut is already used by another application.
In this case, you can use the tray icon to open the settings and change the shortcut.

## The Navigation Modes

Kando offers three different navigation modes: **Point and Click**, **Marking Mode**, and **Turbo Mode**.
At first, you will probably use the point-and-click method.
Once you get more comfortable with Kando, you can try the marking mode, and even the turbo mode.
Watch the video below or read on to learn more about these modes.

### Point and Click

The most basic approach for selecting items is by clicking at them. Although you do not have to click directly at the item, anywhere in the item's wedge will do! 

<Aside type="tip">
This can make selections very fast as you **do not have to aim carefully**.
</Aside>


### Marking Mode

With Kando, you can select items by drawing gestures! To do so, simply press your left mouse button, and drag over an item. You will move the item around, until you stop the movement or make a sharp turn. Try to remember the path to an item and draw it without looking much at the menu! You will be surprised how quickly you can select items which are deeply nested in the menu.

<Aside type="tip">
For successful selections in Marking Mode, it is better to **draw expressive zig-zag lines** instead of shy and curvy lines.
</Aside>


### Turbo Mode

If you opened the menu using a key combination, you can keep a key pressed. If you do so, the menu will behave as if the left mouse button is pressed, and you can easily browse through the menu without having to click anywhere. Once you release the key, the currently dragged item will be selected. **This allows you to make even faster selections!** 
 
<Aside type="tip">
Turbo-Mode works best with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>, or <kbd>Meta</kbd>. For all other keys there will be a short delay until Turbo-Mode kicks in. If this delay is too long for your liking, you can hit the key quickly twice - this way Kando will get the key-down event faster and Turbo-Mode will work right out of the box!
</Aside>


## Alternative Navigation Modes

People are different and so are their preferences.
Therefore, Kando comes with options like the **"Centered Mode"** or the **"Anchored Mode"** which change the default navigation modes.
Especially on smaller üëÜ touch screens or with üéÆ gamepad input, these options may be beneficial.

You can watch the video linked above to get an idea of how these modes work.

<Aside type="note">
We recommend to learn the default behavior first and only change it if you are really sure that it is not working for you. It may take some time to get used to it, but it is worth it! You will be surprised how fast you _can do_ something after you mastered it! üç∞üöÄ
