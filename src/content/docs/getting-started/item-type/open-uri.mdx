description: An Kando item which opens a URI.
tableOfContents: false
---

An URI item can not only be used to open a website but also to open any URI that your operating system can handle.
This includes opening files, directories, or even other applications.

## Example URIs

**http://example.com** - Opens the website `example.com` in your default browser.

**file:///path/to/file.txt** - Opens the file `file.txt` in your default text editor.

**mailto:foo@bar.com** - Opens your default email client to send an email.

## Example Configuration

If you happen to edit your `menus.json` file by hand, you can create an Open-URI item with something like the following.
You can read more about the structure of the `menus.json` file in its [documentation](/reference/config-files).

The `data` property of the menu item must contain a `uri` property which contains the URI to open.

```json title="menus.json"
// ...
{
  "name": "GitHub",
  "type": "uri",
  "icon": "github",
  "iconTheme": "simple-icons",
  "data": {
    "uri": "https://github.com"
  }
},
// ...
```
