<Intro>
This type is used to simulate complex keyboard macros.
You can use this to automate tasks that require multiple keyboard shortcuts or key presses in sequence.
</Intro>

You can use the menu editor to record a complete macro and edit the recorded events if needed.
You can specify a delay between each key press if there is a need for it.
See [Valid Key Names](/valid-keynames) for details on the format of the individual key names.

## <Icon name="solar:sort-by-time-line-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> The Delayed Option

The item has an optional **Delayed** property which you can enable or disable.
If enabled, the macro will be executed _after_ the Kando window is closed.
This can be useful if the macro targets another window which needs to be focused.

## <Icon name="solar:settings-bold-duotone" class="inline-icon" /> Example Configuration

If you happen to edit your `menus.json` file by hand, you can create a Macro item with something like the following.
You can read more about the structure of the `menus.json` file in its [documentation](/config-files).

The `data` property of the menu item must contain a `macro` property which contains a list of keyboard events to simulate.
The optional `delayed` property will ensure that the hotkey is executed _after_ the Kando window is closed.

For instance, this menu item will type "Hi" on most keyboard layouts:

```json title="menus.json"
// ...
{
  "type": "macro",
  "data": {
    "macro": [
      {
        "type": "keyDown",
        "key": "ShiftLeft",
        "delay": 10
      },
      {
        "type": "keyDown",
        "key": "KeyH",
        "delay": 10
      },
      {
        "type": "keyUp",
        "key": "KeyH",
        "delay": 10
      },
      {
        "type": "keyUp",
        "key": "ShiftLeft",
        "delay": 10
      },
      {
        "type": "keyDown",
        "key": "KeyI",
        "delay": 10
      },
      {
        "type": "keyUp",
        "key": "KeyI",
        "delay": 10
      }
    ],
    "delayed": true
  },
  "name": "Hello World",
  "icon": "keyboard_keys",
  "iconTheme": "material-symbols-rounded"
},
// ...
