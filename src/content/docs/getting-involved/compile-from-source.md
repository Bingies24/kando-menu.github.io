macOS: If you run Kando from source, you will need to grant the permissions to the terminal you are using to start Kando.
You will have to grant Kando Accessibility and Screen Recording permissions in the system settings. Accessibility permissions are required to simulate key presses and move the mouse cursor. Screen Recording permissions are required to get the name of the currently focused window.
