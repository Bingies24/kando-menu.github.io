While Kando does not have a cross-platform way to open menus with a mouse button, there are many platform-dependent third-party tools which can help you with this.
With some creativity, you can open menus not only with mouse buttons but also with gestures, desktop widgets, or in many other ways.

You can either make the third-party tool open the menu by simulation the shortcut for the menu, or it can directly call the Kando executable with the `--menu "menu name"` argument.
